## Additional Event Info

<h2>Workshop Description</h2>
This workshop is intended to reach out to women, non-binary people, and people of color who are interested in learning frontend web development with Elm! If you are a white man, you're welcome to attend as the +1 of a woman, non-binary person, or person of color attending. We are emphatically queer & trans inclusive!

In this workshop, we'll take you through the process of building interactive web applications using <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>, a delightful frontend language for reliable webapps. By the end of the day, you'll have built an interactive webapp and have a basic understanding of functional programming.

We'll start the morning with installing all of the software needed, and then spend the rest of the day learning and writing code. To attend this event, you should have at least some familiarity with another programming language (like Ruby, Python, or Javascript).  Students will be separated into different classes based on the experience level they choose when signing up.  If you are completely new to programming, you should look at attending a RailsBridge event instead, or wait for a future ElmBridge event when we hope to offer more-introductory workshops.
